It also makes use of the Ninja Geocode API, which converts a specified location based on country and city to send longitude and latitude coordinates.

Please ensure to create your Ninja API account first, and copypaste your personal API key into the header.

run the "npm i" command in the terminal, to install all the npm packages (express, iso-country-currency, axios, cors...)
