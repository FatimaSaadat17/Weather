# Weather-App
This weather app uses the MET weather Locationforecast/2.0 API , please read documentation for further info: https://docs.api.met.no/doc/

Please ensure to follow the guidelines by providing a business (not personal) email address in the User-Agent header

It also makes use of the Ninja Geocode api, which converts a specified location based on country, and city to send longitude and latitude coordinates.

Please ensure to create your Ninja api account find, and copypaste your personal API key into the header.

Any improvement in code are appreciated!
